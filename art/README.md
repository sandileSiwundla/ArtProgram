# Public Domain Art Vault 🖼️⏳

*A living, breathing gallery preserving humanity's artistic heritage in its true form*

## 🌟 About This Project

I've created a decentralized archive of **almost 900 public domain artworks** (rapidly approaching 1,000!) to combat the growing issues of:

- **AI reinterpretation** that distorts original artistic intent
- **Centralized platforms** that disappear artworks without warning
- **Cultural memory loss** as digital works degrade over time

Browse our collection through elegant **vertical carousels** that showcase each piece in its original glory.

## 🖌️ View the Collection

All artworks are permanently hosted on IPFS under:

*(Current CID: QmdgfEzztgPRZmhKoeAJvdToKG4bhkvg7fwmWehv6LKxS7)*

The images are organized in the public directory under `art`:


## 🔒 Data Persistence Architecture

**Current Protection:**
✅ **Permanently pinned** to my dedicated IPFS node  
✅ **Mirrored** on 3 backup servers  
✅ **900+ images** already cached by network peers

**Long-Term Plan:**
1. **Community Pinning** - Help create a distributed backup network
2. **Filecoin Integration** - Cold storage for historical preservation
3. **Arweave Backup** - Truly permanent blockchain storage
